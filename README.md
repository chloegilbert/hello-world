# hello-world

Hi

I'm a SharePoint architect of many year's experience (embarrassing bit: since 2002 or so...), but for the last three years I've been concentrating on Office 365 SharePoint, O365 Groups, Nintex forms and workflows, and trying to expand my knowledge of Javascript, Typescript, Node.js, React and all things developy.
